I’m worried that other researchers will make use of my data and get better results.
I’m fine with my personal data being used for important or groundbreaking scientific research as long as it’s anonymized.
I’m not sure how to begin making my data open. The process seems complicated.
There is insufficient training in documenting the process of making data open.
Decisions to make data open should be a responsibility of the institution, not of the individual researcher.
My collaborators don’t seem to care about protecting personal data.
I want to work with open data but it's easy to identify individuals in pseudonymized data. 
My research is so specific. Nobody else would be interested in or be able to understand my data.
