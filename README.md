# Open to Discussion

## Description

A major barrier in the shift to open science is that members of the open science community, like much of academia, operate independent of one another. 'Open to Discussion' will give scientists and academics space to come together and engage in more conversations about what working open means for their work. Through a playful group exercise that involves a deck of cards, the goal is to facilitate listening and candidness among participants. Participants will pick a card, read a statement, and have some time to address the challenges raised.

There are different topic areas for discussion on the cards.  Here are the links to the different topic areas:  
[Open Access](https://github.com/baricks/opentodiscussion/blob/master/OpenAccess)  
[Open Collaboration](https://github.com/baricks/opentodiscussion/blob/master/OpenCollaboration)  
[Open Data](https://github.com/baricks/opentodiscussion/blob/master/OpenData)   
[Open Education](https://github.com/baricks/opentodiscussion/blob/master/OpenEducation)

## Goals

Weâ€™re excited about the potential to use this card deck as a way to ignite informal and interactive broader conversations about how scientists, academics, and practitioners are thinking about Open Science. With this game, we want to encourage more people to have face-to-face, candid discussions about both the challenges and advantages of Open Science.
The goal of this project is to develop a card deck to be used at conferences, meetups, NGOs, universities, and research institutes to ignite new conversations.

## Opportunities to help

Looking for help with: user testing, design, and localization (translation). 
Designing customized card decks (for scientists from different fields).
