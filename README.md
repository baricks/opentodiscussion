# Open to Discussion

## Description

A major barrier in the shift to open science is that members of the open science community, like much of academia, operate independent of one another. 'Open to Discussion' will give scientists and academics space to come together and engage in more conversations about what working open means for their work. Through a playful group exercise that involves a deck of cards, the goal is to facilitate listening and candidness among participants. Participants will pick a card, read a statement, and have some time to address the challenges raised.
