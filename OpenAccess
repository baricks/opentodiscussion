My supervisor doesn’t want me to submit my work to preprint servers. 
I just want to get published. I don’t care if the journal has an open access policy. 
As long as the journal has a good impact factor, open access doesn’t matter. 
I want my research to  be published in the most prestigious journals only, even if they don’t have open access policies. 
An open access policy fuels innovation because those who cannot afford to pay journal subscriptions benefit most from it. 
Scientific publishing will always be dominated by established, commercial publishing houses.
I would like to publish in an open access journal but can’t afford the fees.
