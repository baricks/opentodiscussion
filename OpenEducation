I spent hours working on my slides and my syllabus, so I don’t see why I should share them.
I want to be credited for all the work I put into designing the curriculum, even if I share it with other educators. 
I’ve been told that commercial educational materials are more reliable but I’m not sure.
There is too much overlapping material and curriculum already out there in education.
