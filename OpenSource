Open source means that every part of my code should be shared.
I’m nervous that others will find faults with my research results if my code is open.
I spent hours debugging and troubleshooting my code, so I’m not going to give it away for free.
I use open source software but to be honest I don’t know how to contribute.
My institution pays to purchase licenses so I don’t need to use open source projects.
In research projects, we should set aside part of the budget to spend on making the results openly available.
