If I share my work with other researchers, they might try to claim my work as their own. 
I don’t want to invest a lot of time helping others who might end up taking all the credit.
If I choose to collaborate with other researchers on a project, I don’t understand who will be the first author of the publication.
Contributing to collaborative projects has helped improve my productivity.
