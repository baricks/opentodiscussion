We have an intital set of statements covering 5 different areas: <br/>

[Open Access](https://github.com/baricks/opentodiscussion/blob/master/OpenAccess) <br/>
[Open Data](https://github.com/baricks/opentodiscussion/blob/master/OpenData) <br/>
[Open Source](https://github.com/baricks/opentodiscussion/blob/master/OpenSource) <br/>
[Open Collaboration](https://github.com/baricks/opentodiscussion/blob/master/OpenCollaboration) <br/>
[Open Education](https://github.com/baricks/opentodiscussion/blob/master/OpenEducation)<br/>

While we tried to make this first set of statements broad, we would like to develop customized sets for scientists from different fields. <br/>
We would like to hear feedback/suggestions about the suggested statements.
<br/>
We also need help for: <br/>
- Translation <br/>
- Designing customized card decks (for scientists from different fields)<br/>
