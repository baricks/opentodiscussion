Each card will have a statement on it. We came up with a few statements covering 5 different areas: Open Data, Open source, Open access, Open education and Open collaboration.
We have an intital set of statements: <br/>
[Open Access](https://github.com/baricks/opentodiscussion/blob/master/OpenAccess) <br/>
[Open Data](https://github.com/baricks/opentodiscussion/blob/master/OpenData) <br/>
[Open Source](https://github.com/baricks/opentodiscussion/blob/master/OpenSource) <br/>
[Open Collaboration](https://github.com/baricks/opentodiscussion/blob/master/OpenCollaboration) <br/>
[Open Education](https://github.com/baricks/opentodiscussion/blob/master/OpenEducation)<br/>
We tried to make this first set of statements broad and will work on developping customized sets for scientists from different. We would like to hear feedback/suggestions about the suggested statements.
<br/>
We also need help for: <br/>
- Translation <br/>
- Designing customized card decks (for scientists from different fields)<br/>
